# ðŸŽ¯ Real-Time Face Detection using Deep Learning (VGG16 + OpenCV)

A powerful real-time face detection system built with **TensorFlow**, **OpenCV**, and a custom-trained **VGG16** model. It leverages deep learning for accurate face detection from live webcam streams, with support for **data augmentation** using Albumentations and visual insights via Matplotlib. This project is optimized for GPU processing (tested on Nvidia 1650 Ti).

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x** â€“ Programming language
- **pandas & NumPy** â€“ Data manipulation and numerical ops
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** â€“ Visualization tools
- **NLTK (VADER)** â€“ Rule-based sentiment analysis
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)** â€“ PRoBERTa model for deep learning sentiment detection
- **scipy.special.softmax** â€“ Probability distribution from logits
- **tqdm** â€“ Real-time progress bars during analysis
- **RoBERTa (cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment)** â€“ Transformer model for social media style text

## ðŸ“¸ Project Highlights

-  Uses real Amazon food product reviews (from Kaggle) with user ratings (1â€“5 stars)
-  Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on rating distributions
-  Applies text preprocessing: tokenization, POS tagging, lemmatization
-  Implements VADER sentiment scoring: negative, neutral, positive, and compound scores
-  Integrates RoBERTa-based sentiment scoring using Hugging Face Transformers
-  Compares VADER vs RoBERTa outputs visually and numerically
-  Detects and highlights rating vs sentiment mismatches (e.g. 1-star reviews with positive sentiment)
-  Achieves 87% accuracy on unseen data, showing strong generalization to real-world reviews
-  Plots score trends, distribution charts, and scatter comparisons
-  Clean and modular code structure using pandas DataFrames and reusable functions
